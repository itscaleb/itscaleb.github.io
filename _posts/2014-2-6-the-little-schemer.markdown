*Phew.* That was tough, and a *lot* of work. But I finally did it, I finished *The Little Schemer*. And it was *fun.* Usually I don't associate technical books with the word fun, but this is the exception.

At first glance, *The Little Schemer* looks fairly inconspicuous coming in at just over 190 pages and with a small paperback binding. But despite the small form factor, it is absolutely packed with content. It took me nearly two months from start to finish before I felt like I really understood the material. It's probably the most difficult technical book I've read (which isn't saying much), and it was not uncommon to have to read a chapter two or three times to let it sink in.

Having said all that, it's also the most entertaining technical book I've ever read. The content is presented in an unusual Q&A format. As the authors describe it in the preface, *"the book is a dialog between you and us about interesting examples of Scheme programs."* Each page is divided into two columns, with the first column asking the reader a question, and the right column containing the response. The authors don't supply any definitions of the terminology they use in the questions. Instead, they ask questions to guide the reader into forming their own definitions, and to understand the material.

Sometimes the Q&A format leaves a huge burden on the reader. Chapter 11 walks you through deriving the Y combinator. Unfortunately, doing so is *very difficult.* At the end of the chapter, one of the last questions asks, *"Do you know why Y works?"* The response to the question is *"Read this chapter just one more time and you will."* So I read it again. And again.  And then I got stuck for a while. Luckily someone from my study group recommended that I watch an amazing conference talk about the Y combinator. So I watched that twice. Then I came back to the book and read the chapter one more time. And then I gave up, because I still couldn't answer the question. Finally, a few days later, I gave it one last chance and I felt like I could kinda sorta answer it.  Maybe.

The preface states that the goal of this book is to get you to think recursively.  And you will be much better at recognizing different patterns in recursive functions. You will also be able to write recursive list processing and list building functions blindfolded. *The Little Schemer* also introduces the reader to many functional programming concepts such as lambdas and writing higher-order functions. You will end up writing some pretty neat programs too. Two of the highlights for me were writing a Scheme interpreter in Scheme and discovering the Y combinator. But you will have to work for it, and it won't be easy (I feel like I'm repeating myself here).

After I finished the book, I read through the preface one last time. I was surprised that the authors write "This book will not introduce you to the practical world of programming," because I couldn't disagree more. I've been able to immediately apply what I've learned through *The Little Schemer* in my day-to-day coding, and I'm amazed at how much better my code is already.

Reading the little schemer will require a lot of time, and a lot of effort. But it is a very rewarding experience, especially to anyone that is trying to get a feel for what functional programming is all about.
