I stole the title of this post from the intructory chaper of *Realm of Racket*, the book a study group which I'm a part of is currently working through.
Racket is a programming language in the lisp family, and an open parenthesis '(' always marks the beginning of a new expression.

I've been meaning to start blogging for a little while now but never got around
to it because of the hassle involved in setting everything up. But recently, my co-worker Lance told me that github pages are powered by jekyll which made it surprisingly
simple to get this all going.

Now to introduce myself: My name is Caleb and I'm a software developer in Seattle, WA.
I've been working at NBC News Digital for about a year now, where I help develop NBCNews.com along with a really cool group of people.
We have some pretty neat things going on at the moment and it has been a lot of fun so far.

Prior to that I worked at HP for one year. I couldn't have asked for a better experience as my first job right out of school.

Ok, enough about me since nobody cares. Lets see if I can put up some real content.
