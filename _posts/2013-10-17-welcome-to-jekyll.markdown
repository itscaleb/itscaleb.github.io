I've been meaning to start blogging for a little while now but never got around
to it because of the hassle involved in setting everything up.

Recently my co-worker Lance told me that github pages are powered by jekyll which makes
it very simple to set up a blog. So I'm trying it out.

Now to introduce myself: My name is Caleb and I'm a software developer in Seattle, WA.
I've been working at NBC News Digital for about a year now, where I help develop NBCNews.com along with a really cool group of people.
We have some pretty neat things going on at the moment and it has been a lot of fun so far.

Prior to that, I worked at HP for one year.

Ok, enough about me since nobody cares. Lets see if I can get up some real content.
